# Mlox Programming Language Project ðŸŽ‡
This project is inspired by the book [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/) by  **Robert Nystrom**. It is my personal journey of learning and applying concepts from the book, focusing on building a functional interpreter step-by-step.

ðŸš§ Future chapters: Upcoming plans inshallah

# Mlox Grammar:
**Literals:** `Numbers`, `Strings`, `Booleans` and `null`. \
**Unary expressions:** `!` for not, and `-` to negative. \
**Binary expressions:*** (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and (`==`, `!=`, `<`, `<=`, `>,` `>=`). \
**Parentheses:** `(` and `)`. 
```
expression     â†’ literal
               | unary
               | binary
               | grouping ;

literal        â†’ NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "null" ;
grouping       â†’ "(" expression ")" ;
unary          â†’ ( "-" | "!" ) expression ;
binary         â†’ expression operator expression ;
operator       â†’ "==" | "!=" | "<" | "<=" | ">" | ">="
               | "+"  | "-"  | "*" | "/" ;
```

# Mlox Precedence Rules:
```
expression     â†’ equality ;
equality       â†’ comparison ( ( "!=" | "==" ) comparison )* ;
comparison     â†’ term ( ( ">" | ">=" | "<" | "<=" ) term )* ;
term           â†’ factor ( ( "-" | "+" ) factor )* ;
factor         â†’ unary ( ( "/" | "*" ) unary )* ;
unary          â†’ ( "!" | "-" ) unary
               | primary ;
primary        â†’ NUMBER | STRING | "true" | "false" | "null"
               | "(" expression ")" ;
```
